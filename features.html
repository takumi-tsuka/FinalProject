                        Udon noodles are made from wheat, pure water, and salt, and are served in a broth made from various dried fish, dried seaweed, dried shiitake mushrooms, and other dried foods, which are then poured over or dipped into the noodles.

                        Udon is a common food eaten throughout Japan, and it is no exaggeration to say that udon is a part of each region's culture, and even of Japan's culture, as the thickness of udon noodles and the type of broth used vary from region to region. It is said that the history of udon goes back hundreds of years.

                            <p>
                                Udon is said to have originated in China. There is a theory that it was introduced via the Silk Road to the west as pasta and then to Japan as udon. It is believed to have changed depending on the local environment.

                            <h4 id="list-item-2">how did it come?</h4>
                            <p>
                                There is a theory that udon was introduced from China during the Nara period (710-794) and was called "udon" after a snack called "konton".
                                Another popular theory is that a Japanese Buddhist monk named Kukai went to China to study and introduced udon to the Chinese people when he returned.
                            </p>
                            <h4 id="list-item-3">how did it change?</h4>
                            <p>
                                It is said that before the Edo period(1603-1867), udon was shaped like crushed dumplings, but it is believed that during the Edo period, udon took its present string-like form. A study of udon in various parts of Japan shows that many of them took on their current udon shape during the Edo period.

                            <p>
                                Tempura with various ingredients, egg and egg topping, etc. were developed in the mid to late Edo period, and are still loved by the Japanese as a food for the common people, unchanged from the Edo period.

            <p>
                Udon noodles, as mentioned above, are made from high-quality wheat, pure water, and mineral-rich salt. Udon noodles are eaten all over Japan, but most regions, especially famous ones, have these conditions in place. Udon noodles are very easy to digest, and it is said that eating udon noodles when you have a cold or are sick will make you feel better.

                            Sanuki udon is an udon made in Kagawa Prefecture and is most notable for the firmness of its noodles.
                            They are soft in the mouth and glutinous when chewed. This is produced by adding salt water to reduce the breakdown of the wheat protein.

                            The soup used for udon is made from something called ”dashi”. Dashi is made from seafood and other ingredients. Dashi soup stock contains a large amount of ”umami”, a nutrient that affects the sense of taste along with sweetness, saltiness, acidity, and bitterness. When soup stock made from various ingredients is combined, the umami taste is further increased. This is what enhances the taste of udon.

                                Katsuobushi (Bonito flakes) contain a large amount of a flavor component called inosinic acid. Katsuobushi are considered to be the soul food of the Japanese people, and are an indispensable part of Japanese cuisine, not only udon.

                                he main umami component of niboshi dashi is inosinic acid, the same as in katsuobushi, but it is less acidic than katsuobushi and produces dashi with a strong aroma. It also has both richness and mildness.
